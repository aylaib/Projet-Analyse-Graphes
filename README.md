# Graph Algorithms Implementation and Complexity Analysis
This project was carried out as part of the "Advanced Algorithms and Complexity" module for the Master 1 in Bioinformatics at USTHB (Year 2023/2024).
It is a Python implementation of fundamental graph operations, accompanied by an analysis of their complexity. The project explores the two main graph representations (adjacency matrix and adjacency list) and compares their performance.
## üìú Description
The `graph_analyzer.py` program offers a command-line interface to:
- Build graphs, directed or undirected.
- Display graphically the created structures.
- Execute a series of algorithmic analyses on the current graph.
## ‚ú® Features
The program implements the following operations:
- **Creation and Display:**
  - Construction of directed and undirected graphs.
  - Graphical visualization using `matplotlib`.
- **Property Analysis:**
  - Calculation of graph **density**.
  - Calculation of **degrees** (simple degree, in-degree and out-degree).
  - Verification if a graph is **Eulerian**.
  - Verification if a graph is **Complete**.
  - Verification if a graph is a **Tree**.
- **Traversal and Search Algorithms:**
  - Search for **all simple paths** between two nodes.
  - Search for the **shortest path** between two nodes (based on number of edges).
  - Identification of all **cycles** in a directed graph.
